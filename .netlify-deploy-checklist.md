# Netlify Deployment Checklist ‚úÖ

## Pre-Deployment Verification

### ‚úÖ Build Configuration
- [x] `npm run build` completes successfully
- [x] `netlify.toml` configuration file created
- [x] Next.js Netlify plugin installed (`@netlify/plugin-nextjs`)
- [x] Build outputs to `.next` directory
- [x] All TypeScript type errors resolved

### ‚úÖ Required Files
- [x] `package.json` - Contains correct build scripts
- [x] `netlify.toml` - Netlify configuration
- [x] `next.config.mjs` - Next.js configuration with security headers
- [x] `.gitignore` - Properly ignores .env and build artifacts

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Environment Variables Required
Before deploying, set these in Netlify Dashboard:
- [ ] `NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID` (Required)
- [ ] Optional RPC URLs (for better performance):
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_MAINNET_RPC_URL`
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_ARBITRUM_RPC_URL`
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_OPTIMISM_RPC_URL`
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_RPC_URL`
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_POLYGON_RPC_URL`

## Deployment Commands

### Test Build Locally
```bash
npm run build
```

### Deploy to Netlify
1. **Via Git Integration (Recommended)**
   - Push your code to GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket
   - Connect repository in Netlify Dashboard
   - Configure environment variables
   - Netlify will auto-deploy on push

2. **Via Netlify CLI**
   ```bash
   npm install -g netlify-cli
   netlify login
   netlify deploy --prod
   ```

## Build Output Verification

After build completes, verify:
- ‚úÖ Exit code: 0 (success)
- ‚úÖ Static pages generated
- ‚úÖ Routes created successfully
- ‚úÖ No critical errors (warnings about React Native async-storage are expected and safe to ignore)

## Post-Deployment Testing

Once deployed:
1. [ ] Visit the deployed URL
2. [ ] Test wallet connection (WalletConnect, MetaMask)
3. [ ] Verify token selector works
4. [ ] Test swap interface functionality
5. [ ] Check responsive design on mobile
6. [ ] Verify all images and assets load
7. [ ] Test navigation and routing
8. [ ] Check browser console for errors

## Known Safe Warnings

These warnings can be ignored:
- `Module not found: Can't resolve '@react-native-async-storage/async-storage'`
  - This is from MetaMask SDK and is expected in web-only environment
- `DeprecationWarning: The 'punycode' module is deprecated`
  - From dependencies, doesn't affect functionality

## Netlify Configuration Details

### Build Settings
```toml
Build command: npm run build
Publish directory: .next
Node version: 20
```

### Features Enabled
- ‚úÖ Next.js optimization plugin
- ‚úÖ Security headers (CORS, CSP, XSS protection)
- ‚úÖ Static asset caching (1 year)
- ‚úÖ Gzip compression
- ‚úÖ SPA routing with redirects

## Troubleshooting

### Build Fails
1. Check environment variables are set
2. Clear Netlify build cache
3. Verify Node version is 20+
4. Check build logs for specific errors

### Wallet Connection Issues
1. Verify `NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID` is set
2. Check WalletConnect project is active
3. Test in incognito/private browsing mode

### Assets Not Loading
1. Check public folder is committed to git
2. Verify image paths are correct (use `/` prefix)
3. Check Netlify asset optimization settings

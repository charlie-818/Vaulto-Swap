## Step 3: Understanding RWA Types

Before trading, understand the different RWA categories available:

### Tokenized Treasuries
- **OUSG** - Short-term US government bonds
- **USDY** - USD yield-bearing token
- **OMMF** - Money market fund tokens

### Tokenized Equities
- **Major Stocks** - Apple, Tesla, Google, Amazon, Microsoft
- **Sector ETFs** - Technology, healthcare, energy funds
- **Index Funds** - S&P 500, NASDAQ indices

### Tokenized Commodities
- **Precious Metals** - Gold, silver, platinum tokens
- **Energy** - Oil, natural gas tokens

## Step 4: Execute Your First Trade

### Example Trade: USDC → OUSG (Treasury Token)
1. **From Token**: Select USDC from the dropdown
2. **To Token**: Select OUSG (Ondo Short-Term US Government Bond Fund)
3. **Enter Amount**: Type the amount you want to trade (e.g., 1000 USDC)

### Review the Trade
- **Price**: Check the current exchange rate
- **Price Impact**: Review how your trade affects the price (lower is better)
- **Network Fee**: See the estimated gas cost
- **Minimum Received**: Your guaranteed minimum output

### Execute the Swap
1. Click "Swap" to submit your trading intent
2. Approve Token (if first time trading this token)
3. Confirm Swap - sign the transaction
4. Wait for Batch Execution - CoW Protocol will find optimal execution

## Step 5: Verify Your Trade

After the transaction confirms:
1. Check your wallet - you should see the new RWA tokens
2. View transaction - click the transaction hash to see details on block explorer
3. Trade history - your swap appears in the CoW Swap widget history

## Trading Strategies

### Yield Optimization
Swap between different treasury tokens (OUSG, USDY, OMMF) to optimize yield while maintaining government security exposure.

### Portfolio Diversification
- **Stocks → Commodities**: Diversify equity exposure with precious metals
- **Stablecoins → Treasuries**: Earn yield on stable assets
- **Crypto → RWAs**: Balance crypto volatility with traditional assets

### Risk Management
- Start with small amounts to understand price dynamics
- Monitor price impact for larger trades
- Consider dollar-cost averaging for regular RWA exposure

## Quick Tips

### For Better Execution
- Trade during off-peak hours for lower network congestion
- Use Arbitrum or Optimism for lower fees
- Larger trades may have better price impact due to batch aggregation

### Managing Gas Fees
- Use L2 networks (Arbitrum, Optimism, Base) for cheaper fees
- Monitor gas prices before trading
- Consider batching multiple trades

### Stay Secure
- Always verify token addresses and symbols
- Check price impact before trading
- Never share your private keys
- Use hardware wallets for large amounts

## Common Issues

### "Insufficient Balance"
- Ensure you have enough of the token you're selling
- Check if you need to approve the token first
- Verify you have ETH for gas fees

### "High Price Impact"
- Try a smaller trade size
- Wait for better liquidity conditions
- Consider splitting large trades

### "Token Not Found"
- Verify the token is available on your current network
- Check if the RWA provider supports your chosen chain
- Refresh the token list

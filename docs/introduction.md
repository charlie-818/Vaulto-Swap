# Introduction to Vaulto

Vaulto is a permissionless DeFi protocol that enables seamless swapping of Real World Assets (RWAs) across EVM chains. Built on CoW Swap's MEV-protected batch auction engine, Vaulto provides institutional-grade access to tokenized securities, commodities, and treasury instruments with optimal execution and settlement.

## How Vaulto Works

Vaulto leverages CoW Protocol's intent-based trading model to aggregate liquidity and execute trades at optimal prices:

1. **Intent Submission**: Users submit trading intents specifying desired token pairs and amounts
2. **Batch Aggregation**: CoW Protocol aggregates intents and finds optimal execution paths
3. **MEV Protection**: Batch auctions prevent front-running and sandwich attacks
4. **On-Chain Settlement**: All trades settle directly on-chain with no intermediaries

This architecture ensures users receive the best available prices while maintaining full custody of their assets.

- **Arbitrum** - Fast and cheap (recommended)

2. Select "Switch Network" or use your wallet's network switcher

## Step 3: Enable Regulated Assets (30 seconds)

Tokenized stocks require compliance verification:
1. **Toggle the "Enable Regulated Assets"** switch in the header
2. **Read and accept** the compliance warning
3. **Confirm** that you're eligible to trade tokenized securities

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: Only enable this if you're legally allowed to trade tokenized securities in your jurisdiction.

## Step 4: Make Your First Trade (2 minutes)

### Select Tokens
1. **From Token**: Click the dropdown and select USDC (or your preferred stablecoin)
2. **To Token**: Click the dropdown and select bAAPL (or any tokenized stock)
3. **Enter Amount**: Type the amount you want to trade (e.g., "100" for $100 worth)

### Review the Trade
- **Price**: Check the current exchange rate
- **Price Impact**: Review how your trade affects the price (lower is better)
- **Network Fee**: See the estimated gas cost
- **Minimum Received**: Your guaranteed minimum output

### Execute the Swap
1. **Click "Swap"** to initiate the transaction
2. **Approve Token** (if first time trading this token) - sign the approval transaction
3. **Confirm Swap** - sign the swap transaction
4. **Wait for Confirmation** - usually takes 30 seconds to 2 minutes

## Step 5: Verify Your Trade

After the transaction confirms:
1. **Check your wallet** - you should see the new tokens
2. **View transaction** - click the transaction hash to see details on block explorer
3. **Trade history** - your swap appears in the CoW Swap widget history

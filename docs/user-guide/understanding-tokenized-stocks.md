# Understanding Tokenized Stocks

Tokenized stocks are blockchain representations of traditional securities that allow you to trade company stocks using cryptocurrency. This guide explains what they are, how they work, and what you need to know before trading them.

## What Are Tokenized Stocks?

Tokenized stocks are digital tokens that represent ownership of traditional securities (like company stocks) on the blockchain. Each token is backed by real stock shares held by a regulated custodian.

### **Key Characteristics**
- **Blockchain-based**: Tradeable as ERC-20 tokens on Ethereum and other networks
- **Backed by real assets**: Each token represents actual stock shares
- **24/7 trading**: Unlike traditional markets, available around the clock
- **Fractional ownership**: Buy partial shares (e.g., 0.1 Apple stock)
- **Global access**: Trade from anywhere in the world (where legally permitted)

## 🚀 Next Steps

### 1. Get Your WalletConnect Project ID
Visit [WalletConnect Cloud](https://cloud.walletconnect.com) and create a project.

### 2. Configure Environment
```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Edit `.env.local` and add your WalletConnect Project ID:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id_here
```

### 3. Start Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

### 4. Deploy Smart Contracts (Optional)
When ready to deploy to testnets, follow the [DEPLOYMENT.md](./DEPLOYMENT.md) guide.

You'll need:
- Testnet ETH (from faucets)
- RPC URLs (Alchemy/Infura)
- Private key for deployment

## 🧪 Testing the Interface

1. **Start the dev server** - `npm run dev`
2. **Open in browser** - http://localhost:3000
3. **Connect wallet** - Click "Connect Wallet"
4. **Switch to testnet** - Use Sepolia or Arbitrum Sepolia
5. **Enable regulated assets** - Toggle compliance switch
6. **Select tokens** - Choose stablecoin and tokenized stock
7. **Enter amount** - Type amount or click MAX
8. **Get quote** - Price updates automatically
9. **Execute swap** - Click swap button (requires testnet ETH)

## 📱 Mobile Testing

The interface is fully responsive. Test on:
- iPhone (320px+)
- iPad
- Android devices
- Desktop (all sizes)

## 🎯 Production Checklist

Before deploying to mainnet:

- [ ] Get smart contracts professionally audited
- [ ] Test thoroughly on testnets for 2-4 weeks
- [ ] Deploy contracts to mainnet
- [ ] Verify contracts on Etherscan
- [ ] Update token addresses to real tokenized stocks
- [ ] Set up monitoring and alerts
- [ ] Consider DeFi insurance
- [ ] Legal compliance review
- [ ] Prepare initial liquidity
- [ ] Update frontend with mainnet config
- [ ] Deploy frontend to Vercel/production

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- This is a **demo/prototype** - not production-ready
- Smart contracts are **NOT audited**
- Use only on **testnets** until fully audited
- **Never share** your private keys
- Tokenized stock addresses are **mock examples**
- Real tokenized stocks have **compliance requirements**

# Netlify 404 Error - FIXED ✅

## Problem
Site was showing 404 errors and "Page not found" on deployed Netlify site. Resources were not loading correctly.

## Root Cause
The `netlify.toml` configuration was **conflicting** with the `@netlify/plugin-nextjs` plugin:
- ❌ Specified `publish = ".next"` directory manually
- ❌ Added custom redirects that conflicted with Next.js routing
- ❌ Headers configuration was interfering with deployment

## Solution Applied

### Updated `netlify.toml` to minimal configuration:
```toml
[build]
  command = "npm run build"

[[plugins]]
  package = "@netlify/plugin-nextjs"

[build.environment]
  NODE_VERSION = "20.18.0"
```

### Why This Works
The `@netlify/plugin-nextjs` plugin **automatically handles**:
- ✅ Correct publish directory and output structure
- ✅ Next.js redirects and rewrites
- ✅ Serverless functions for dynamic routes  
- ✅ Static asset optimization
- ✅ ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration) if needed

**Manual configuration was causing conflicts!**

## What Changed
- Removed: `publish = ".next"`
- Removed: Custom redirect rules
- Removed: Custom header configurations (can add back later if needed)
- Added: `.netlify` to `.gitignore`

## Next Steps on Netlify

### 1. Trigger a New Deployment
Since the configuration has been fixed and pushed to GitHub, Netlify will automatically deploy the changes if you have auto-deploy enabled.

**Or manually trigger:**
1. Go to your Netlify dashboard
2. Click "Deploys" tab
3. Click "Trigger deploy" → "Deploy site"

### 2. Clear Cache (Recommended)
To ensure the new configuration is used:
1. Go to Site settings → Build & deploy
2. Click "Clear cache and retry deploy"

### 3. Verify Environment Variables
Make sure you have set:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
```

### 4. Expected Result
After deployment completes (2-3 minutes):
- ✅ Homepage loads at your Netlify URL
- ✅ All static pages work
- ✅ Navigation functions correctly
- ✅ Assets (images, CSS, JS) load properly
- ✅ No 404 errors

## Build Output to Expect

Netlify build log should show:
```
✓ Compiled successfully
✓ Linting and checking validity of types
✓ Generating static pages (7/7)

Route (app)                              Size     First Load JS
┌ ○ /                                    54.6 kB         465 kB
├ ○ /_not-found                          880 B          89.9 kB
├ ○ /manifest.webmanifest                0 B                0 B
├ ○ /robots.txt                          0 B                0 B
└ ○ /sitemap.xml                         0 B                0 B

Plugin "@netlify/plugin-nextjs" ran successfully
```

## Troubleshooting

### If still getting 404s:
1. **Check build logs** - Look for any errors during the plugin execution
2. **Verify Node version** - Should be using 20.18.0
3. **Clear browser cache** - Hard refresh (Cmd+Shift+R or Ctrl+Shift+R)
4. **Check Functions tab** - Next.js plugin should have created functions

### If build fails:
1. Check that `NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID` is set
2. Verify `@netlify/plugin-nextjs` is installed (it is: v5.13.5)
3. Review build logs for specific errors

## Additional Configuration (Optional)

### If you need custom headers later:
You can add them back to `next.config.mjs` instead of `netlify.toml`:
```javascript
headers: async () => {
  return [
    {
      source: '/:path*',
      headers: [
        { key: 'X-Frame-Options', value: 'SAMEORIGIN' },
        { key: 'X-Content-Type-Options', value: 'nosniff' },
        // ... more headers
      ]
    }
  ];
}
```
(These are already in your `next.config.mjs`)

### For custom redirects:
Add to `next.config.js` not `netlify.toml`:
```javascript
redirects: async () => {
  return [
    {
      source: '/old-path',
      destination: '/new-path',
      permanent: true,
    }
  ];
}
```

## Verification Checklist

After deployment:
- [ ] Visit your Netlify URL
- [ ] Check homepage loads (/)
- [ ] Check manifest loads (/manifest.webmanifest)
- [ ] Check sitemap loads (/sitemap.xml)
- [ ] Check robots.txt loads (/robots.txt)
- [ ] Test wallet connection button
- [ ] Check browser console for errors
- [ ] Verify all images load correctly

## Success Indicators

✅ **Site is live and accessible**  
✅ **No 404 errors on main pages**  
✅ **Static assets load from CDN**  
✅ **Navigation works correctly**  
✅ **Web3 functionality initializes**
